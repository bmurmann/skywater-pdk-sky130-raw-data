SkyWater 130nm Open Manufacturing Test Tile
===========================================

Google, NIST, and University of Michigan are working together to create a fully open test tile design using the `OpenFASoC generator approach <https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC>`_ and open source tooling.

sky130_fd_sc_hd, sky130_fd_sc_hs, sky130_fd_sc_hvl based ring osc.
+ 
9 additional OSU standard cell ring osc. : 12T_hs, 12T_ms, 15T_hs, 15T_ls, 15T_ms, 18T_hs, 18T_ls, 18T_ms
